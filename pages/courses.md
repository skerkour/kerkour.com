In 2017 I definitely left my boring office life to launch internet projects and businesses. Today, I'm sharing all the learnings, systems, and methods that I have refined along the way, allowing me to **take back control of my life using technology instead of enduring it**, be **more productive** and to **learn anything**.



<!--

I don't believe in theory only, that's how we end up with whole countries filled with people who think, think, think but never start doing anything.

This is why all the courses start with a theorical background to teach you the immutable laws of the field

and then real-world project to let your practice and learn the current methodologies and tools.

the best of human knowledge backed by science, presented in an actionnable way to get you from zero to hero


the future is here, just not rvenly distributed.

by becoming a member, you get access to a library of actionnable content, backed by science, to use texhnology to imlrove your life instead of aasservur you

Let's Go!
