  <!-- While technology has enabled an unprecedented quality of life, we are slowly realizing that it also has its limits and that it can make our life miserable. Screen addiction, sedentarism, centralization of power, endless streams of notifications, overstimulation, extreme polarization...
  <p>There is an asymmetry between the goals of the industry - unlimited growth, which requires us to become their slaves - and what is good for us. What if, instead of spending your days mindlessly scrolling, you could use technology to your advantage to build the life you always dreamed of.</p>
  < !-- <p>As the saying goes: "The future is already here ‚Äì it's just not very evenly distributed". -- >
  <p>On this blog, I share with you everything I learned along the way of taking back control of my life (ab)using technology:</p>
  the big tech companies want you to become their digital slave

  This is my personal site where I write about how to (ab)use technology for fun and profit: using it to your advantage to make money online and find simple and elegant solutions to the hard problems of modern life ‚òÄÔ∏è
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Programming</strong>: With software we can introduce <strong>automation</strong> and <strong>scale</strong> into our life, which allows us to work less and more efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Hacking</strong>: In order to build great stuff, prevent attacks and defend ourselves we need to understand how to break (into) things.</li>
    <li><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong>: Having your own online business lets you live on your own terms. You do <strong>what</strong> you want, <strong>when</strong> you want, <strong>where</strong> you want. <strong>You don't have to ask the permission.</strong></li>
