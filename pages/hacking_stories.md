# Hacking Stories

I find that a lot of hacking tutorials and posts are boring. On one hand, I understand the authors as hacking is a grey area, and the line is slippery, so they don't want to take risks. On the other hand, it's at the detriment of the most important person, you dear reader.

This is why I want to try a new format: Hacking stories. Hacking stories are fictitious adventures backed by real-world hacking techniques. Their sole purpose is education.


With these stories, I want to share the mindset and techniques of the attackers. What it looks like to be in their shoes, and why they perpetrate their attacks.

<!--
It's the first work of fiction I have written, so please, be indulgent 🙏


Please tell me if you enjoyed it and if you want more stories like that (or not) by replying to this email.
