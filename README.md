While technology has enabled unprecedented quality of life we are slowly realizing that it also has its limits and that it can make our life miserable. Screen addiction, sedentarism, endless notifications, overstimulation, extreme polarization...

There is an asymetry between the interests of the industry (whch is to grow, grow and grow) and what is good for us. What if, instead of spending your days mindlessly scrolling, you could use technology to your advantage to build the life you ever dreamed of.

I share on this blog everything I learned along the way of taking back my freedom using technology:
* **Programming**: By learning to code, you are introducing **automation** and **scale** into your life which allow you to work less.
* **Hacking**: In order to build great things, you need to understamd how to break them.
* **Online business**: Having your own business let you set your own terms in your life. You do what you want, when you want, where you want.

Technology is making us miserable. Don't get me wrong, the latest smartphone is fantastic (I don't know when are you reading this, but I'm sure it is) but then, 12 months later a new one is out, deprecating the ezisting one.

There is an asymetry between how these tech giant can continue to grow (what they want) and what is good for us (what we want).

In this blog I share what I learn along the way to take back control of technology and use it to create the free life I always dreamed of:

    nomadism
    an online business that I can work from anywhere in the world
    digital minimalism

sustainability, autonomy (independence)
which means

learning how to code

how to create an internet business so I can live anywhere in the world and change loxation when I want (

while technology has enabled unprecedented quality of life, we are slowly realising that it has its limits and that it also can make our life miserable. Social media addiction, extreme polarization....
how to hack, because in orser to build reliable things, you need to understamd how they break

how to code, because code is the language of machines, and machines working for you (automation, scale)
