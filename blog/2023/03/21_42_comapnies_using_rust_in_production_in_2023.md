[A lot of people want to learn Rust](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) but are afraid that the language or the ecosystem is not production-ready yet, or that they may not find a job.

Be reassured, Rust is already used in production, from small shops to the largest companies in the world, serving billions of transactions daily, if not hourly. Whether it be for its reliability, productivity, speed, or safety, Rust is a language of choice, **today**.


In 2021 I did an initial review of [42 companies using Rust in production](/rust-in-production-2021). Since then, Rust's has seen an ever growing interest from developers, so here are 42 more companies using Rust in production in 2023.

The list is **not** exhaustive, I picked the following 42 comapnies among my favorite stories about using Rust in production.
