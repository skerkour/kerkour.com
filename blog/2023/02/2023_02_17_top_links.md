Today only one link: [Opt Out](https://roryprice.net/2020/05/01/opt-out/), a fantastic pay-what-you-want book by [Rory Price](https://roryprice.net).

It's a short fiction about a close future where neural implants would become "required" to participate in society. Of course, it was a not-so-bright idea and we can easily make a parallel with smartphones.

The book is a real gem and will make you consider twice before using a technology that everyone take as granted but actually bring your more troubles than it solve problems.
