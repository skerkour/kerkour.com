While developing <a href="https://bloom.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloom</a>
I realized how much I love open source. So I decided to share this passion with the world. Whether it be in software, in hardware, in education, in ecology, in science or in agriculture, open source have proved its superiority.

However it's very difficult to find interesting and quality content in this ocean: just GitHub had over
<a href="https://github.blog/2018-11-08-100m-repos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100M repositories in 2018</a> ü§î


This is why I created the Open Source Weekly letter: the best projects, people and articles on open source, curated by hand.

<div class="text-center mb-5 mt-5">

  <!-- <small class="form-text text-muted">We hate spam even more than you do.
        We'll never share your email and you can unsubscribe at any time.</small> -->
</div>

Whether you want to make your first contribution, discover interesting projects or people, I will do my best to satisfy you.

I believe we are just at the beginning of the open source revolution and this is my contribution to spread its greatness.
