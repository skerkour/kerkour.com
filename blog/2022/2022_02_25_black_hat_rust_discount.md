World is in turmoil.

While we obviously can't predict what is going to happen in the physical world, one thing is sure: Cyberwar will intensify a lot in the coming weeks / months.

This is why I decided to offer a big discount on my book [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust).


<!-- We all woke up with stupor, seeing old ghosts from the past had resurfaced.

Medias kind of warned us for many weeks, but a lot of us didn't want to listen. Either because trust was broken a long time ago or because we simply just felt uncomfortable with the possibility of war.

Now we all feel powerless and not sure about the next steps.

While I can't predict what will happen on the physical side of things, there is one thing I'm sure: Cyberwar will intensify a lot in the coming weeks / months. -->


<!-- And if you are reading this blog, you certainly have a role to play.

This is why I decided to give away my book [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) to all Ukrainians and create a big discount for everybody else, so that as many people as possible can join the cyber forces of the world and defend their freedom.

**If you're living in Ukraine it's free for you, [just send me an email](https://kerkour.com).** -->

The coupon code is: **CYBERSTORM**

<!-- I know it's a bit late, but from where I'm, I think it's the only thing I can currently do. -->


Best wishes

**P.S.**: If you or your family are living in the zone impacted by the war, please [feel free to send me an email](/about).
