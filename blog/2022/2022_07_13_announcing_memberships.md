----------

In 2017 I definitely left my boring office life to launch internet projects and businesses. Since then, I've developed many systems and methods that allow me to be more productive, learn anything, and to tack back control of my freedom using technology.

[As explained a few weeks ago](https://kerkour.com/abusing-technology-for-fun-and-profit), these systems sit on 3 pillars:
* **Programming**: With software, we can introduce **automation** and **scale** into our life, which allows us to work less and more efficiently.
* **Hacking**: In order to build great stuff, prevent attacks and defend ourselves, we need to understand how to break (into) things.
* **Entrepreneurship**: Having your own online business lets you live on your own terms. You do **what** you want, **when** you want, **where** you want. **You don't have to ask permission**.


Today I'm sharing these systems with you so you can use technology for your own benefit instead of being a slave to those controlling it and find success with your own projects by learning directly from my own experience.

For that, I've written many courses that are designed to provide the **simplest** and **fastest** path to results. No fluff, no blahblah. Only practical bits of advice and lessons learned the hard way.


You can access theses courses now by become a premium member of this website.

The first course is **[Black Hat Rust: Applied offensive security with the Rust programming language](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust)**. Yes, you read it right, my book is now available as an online course. You can read more about that in [this dedicated post](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust-update-2022-56).

The second course I'm launching today is **[Technical Writer: 90 days to write, self-publish and sell your first technical book](https://kerkour.com/technical-writer)**.


The third course that I'm launching at the end of the month is **Continuous Learning: The ultimate system to turn information into actionable knowledge and thrive in the information age**.

Finally, in early August I will launch **The complete guide to protect your online privacy and secure your smartphones, tablets and computers**.

After that, I plan to release 1 course every 3 weeks.

## Launch Discount

The first thing I want to tell you is that the premium membership is [**heavily discounted during the launch, at $99 / year**](https://kerkour.com/courses#/portal/subscription) (excluding VAT, if applicable). I will then gradually increase the price as I add more courses to the catalog. As loong as your subscription remains active, you will keep the launch price :)


## Why Online Courses?

Because I value my time, and, more importantly, I value your time.


My courses are designed to save you time, and thus money. They are not free, but by following them instead of making many mistakes like I did, you will save so much time that the price of the membership will be quickly compensated.

I think that our interests are the best aligned with a subscription model: I can focus on creating great content, while you can unsubscribe anytime you feel that you don't get enough value for your money.

I don't believe in other models, such as advertisement-based revenues, which require tracking the readers.

## Will the other content on this blog remain free

I received so many "Thank you" messages, so the *traditional* posts of this blog will remain free forever.

On the other hand, I'm considering giving access only to premium members to some future posts that take me a lot of time to write. For example, I'm currently working on a long article about batteries that required many weeks of effort.


So, if you like my work and want to level up your cyber skills, [Join Us](https://kerkour.com/courses#/portal/subscription).
