A [few months after its official launch](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust-week-2021), I'm extremely happy to announce that I released the biggest [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) update so far: `v2022.56`.

The book has been updated for Rust **1.62**, which means, among other things:
- No longer use the `nightly` channel when the features are now available in stable (`asm`...)
- Update all the dependencies to their current version
- Use `edition = "2021"`
- And many other smaller improvements


> As usual, if you already purchased the book, you can [send me an email](https://kerkour.com) to get the latest version.

But that's not all!

## Black Hat Rust: The Online Course

Black Hat Rust is also now available as an online course as part of the premium membership of this website!

**The course contains the exact same content as the ebook**, and all updates made to the course will also be made available to the ebook readers. It's simply another medium to deliver knowledge that I think is a better fit than a book.
