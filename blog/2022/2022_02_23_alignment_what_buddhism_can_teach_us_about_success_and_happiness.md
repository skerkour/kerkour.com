What is your definition of success?

The answers to this question are almost universally the same:
- Having a lot of money
- Having a lot of sex partners
- Having a high social status

And these answers are universally wrong. They are the default answers, dictated by universal metrics, which are the lowest denominators of the ~8 billion Humans.

Rich or famous people will tell you they are not happy, despite being high on the leaderboard according to these metrics.

Instead, I have 3 questions for you:
- What do you really want?
- What do you really value?
- What are you really doing with your life?

**Misery feels when what one thinks, speaks and acts does not align.**

![Alignment](https://kerkour.com/2022/alignment/alignment.png)

This concept is called alignment in Buddhism.

*The ideal state of tranquility comes from experiencing body and mind being synchronized.*

Tranquility is the only way to end suffering, which is the ultimate definition of success.

## Alignment

<!-- We all have opinions, things we like, things we don't. Some are aware of that, others don't. -->

As always, finding answers to these questions is way simpler than we would like to admit.


The first step is to slow down. Take a break. Escape from the daily busyness. Only then can our mind become clear.

The second step is to write down who you are, what you value.

The third step is to write down what you want. Toward which goals are you going to dedicate your limited time.

The combination of these two manuscripts are your **manifesto**.

Writing them down is important: you'll have the opportunity to take time to profoundly think about their legitimacy and if they present contradictions.

And only then will you be able to align your acts and speak with your thoughts.


So,
- What do you really want?
- What do you really value?
- What are you going to do accordingly?

Finding success is really no more complicated than that.
<!-- In one sentence: stop constantly comparing yourself to others, you'll not only save lot of time, but more importantly, it's the only way to find hapiness in this crazy world. -->
