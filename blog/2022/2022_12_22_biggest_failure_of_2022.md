In 2021 I achieved what : slef-publishing a book (Black Hat Rust).

The book was (ans is still) extremelly well received by the readers, and the success made me optimist about being able to fund my work on Open Source byt turning the knowledge that I learned the hard way into

But then came the question of the format.

Video courses: easy to produce, and easy to consume

Books: The biggest problem of books is the perceived value and the saturated market.

So I tried something: a mix between these 2 formats: written courses. I decided that the best way to transmit knowledge was by creating text-based courses that would be like small books, containing only ultra-curated knowledge: the easiest way for my readers to go from A to B, or said in another way: the simplest way to achieve X.

In my head everything was clear like crystl water

And yet,



So, I hear you asking, what is coming in 2023?

First,

Second, everyone who subscribed to a yearly premium subscription . Everyone who subscribed to a monthly subscription, will get all my books of 2021-2022 for free.

Third, I will disable the monthly subscription, so far it seems that it caused more confusion than anything else.


That being said, I can't wait to share with you the projects I'm working on and the many many articles that I started to write but never finished.

I wish you an happy end of the year, and I want you to know that, even if you made some mistakes in 2022, it's not the end of the world, and you can always readjust :)
