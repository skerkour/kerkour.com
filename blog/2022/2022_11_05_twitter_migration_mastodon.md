I never liked Twitter, but I find that what's happening with Twitter's buyout is absolutely interesting as we can't be sure about the real motive behind each and every decision.

Anyway, selling a subscription and still collecting data and showing ads is, in my opinion, a major offense. That's why you can now follow me on Mastodon: [@sylvain@kerkour.com](https://social.kerkour.com/@sylvain)

Of course, the newsletter and the RSS feed are still available at [https://kerkour.com/subscribe](https://kerkour.com/subscribe)
