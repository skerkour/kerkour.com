<!--
 I think the point of privacy is, it isn't anyone else's business why someone would care about it.

 Privacy is a self-evident and basic human right, like freedom of expression. The principle of this is already acknowledged in law. For example, reading snail mail is very illegal, and nobody questions what harm would come from someone reading Grandmas "merry christmas" letter to you. It is only on the internet that violations of this right are turned a blind eye to, because of regulatory capture and government inertia. Regulators are slowly catching up (see GDPR) but in the meanwhile users are forced to take matters into their own hands.
