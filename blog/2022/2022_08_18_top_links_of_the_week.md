I used to be completely addicted to social link aggregators such as [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and Reddit. In the beginning, they provided great value to me, letting me discover very interesting articles and learn new things.

But over the years, they turned into a harmful habit where I would check them as soon as I had a few minutes or even seconds of free time, thinking that I was learning interesting new things that would be very useful for my *soon-to-come overnight success*â„¢, unlike these social media zombies.

But in reality, I was just playing the same slot machine and feeding my brain with shallow information.

This is why I want to introduce a new section to this blog where I will share with you my favorite websites, articles, videos, or audios of the week, so if you are hooked like I was, you may find a way to quit your social aggregators addiction once and for all.
