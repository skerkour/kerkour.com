Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well üôè


## Did you know

**Which license to choose for my software project?**
There are a LOT of existing software licenses. Like everywhere where there are too many choices it leads to decision paralysis. Fortunately, your humble servant is here to save you time and allow you to do the thing that matters: working on your project.

The first question you have to ask yourself: Do I want the license to be viral? (not sure what it means? Read [issue 1](https://opensourceweekly.org/issues/1#did-you-know) and [issue 2](https://opensourceweekly.org/issues/2#did-you-know))

**Yes**
* For a library or a client side application (like a mobile app or a CLI program): [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
* For server software: [AGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)

**No**
* Use the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license


And that‚Äôs all, really. There are a lot of other licenses but in my experience it‚Äôs not worth the time to investigate them all. The licenses above have our back covered regarding patents, contributions and trademark.




## Announce

I‚Äôm about to release the new version of my open source project [Bloom](https://bloom.sh) (encrypted Notes, Calendar, Contacts, Files‚Ä¶) which will feature end-to-end encryption. Before that I‚Äôm looking for feedback on the cryptographic design, so if you are a cryptography / security enthusiast you are welcome to join the discussion

## Articles

[CLI: improved](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved)
Do you find that the command line is a cold and unpleasant place? Maybe it‚Äôs because you have not yet discovered all the new tools that were developed to replace the old Unix ones.
Here is a collection of tools to add color to your (CLI) life üéâ



[Badger vs LMDB vs BoltDB: Benchmarking key-value databases in Go](https://dgraph.io/blog/post/badger-lmdb-boltdb/)
I don‚Äôt want to re-launch the usual war of programming languages, but as this write-up about *badger* an embedded key-value database demonstrates, Go can achieve extreme performance.

I‚Äôm really not in favor of gaming as a service, but on the technical side this write-up is really good!

## Book

**[The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html)**, *a lot of authors / contributors*

*The Architecture of Open Source Applications* is this kind of precious gem published once in a decade. It‚Äôs a collection (2 volumes, ~25 chapters each) of technical write-ups describing in detail how renowned open source applications (like Git, Hadoop, LLVM, Nginx‚Ä¶) work.

Also, they walk the talk: *"This work is made available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license. [...] All royalties from sales of these books will be donated to Amnesty International."*
So if you are looking for a good technical book, I can‚Äôt recommend this one enough.



Stay safe ‚úåÔ∏è
Sylvain
