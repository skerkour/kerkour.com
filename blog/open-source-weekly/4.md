You are certainly asking yourself what to do with this sudden amount of free time now we are all in quarantine and no longer have to commute every day. The answer is obvious: VIDEO GAMES!!!!
Welcome for a special edition of [OpenSourceWeekly.org](https://OpenSourceWeekly.org) dedicated to gaming üïπÔ∏è


## Gaming on Linux

You no longer need windows for gaming, really (Nabil üëã). Thanks to a joint effort between the community and some companies like Valve (which have great interest not to rely on Microsoft Windows, which is trying to eat their game distribution market). Unfortunately, the games are not open source.


[Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton)
*Proton is a tool for use with the Steam client which allows games which are exclusive to Windows to run on the Linux operating system. It uses [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to facilitate this.*

This is the database of games‚Äô compatibility with Proton (rated from *Borked* to *Native*).

A friendly community of Linux gamers where you‚Äôll find help and assistance when in need. Hardware selection, drivers configuration, system tuning and so on.



## Emulators

Emulators are apps that allow you to play games developed for old consoles. This is a great way to fight obsolescence. Also, a lot of good old games have something that is really missing nowadays: local multiplayer üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶


[Dolphin: GameCube & Wii](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin)
Certainly the consoles with the best local multiplayer games! *Mario Kart,* *Mario party*, *Super Smash Bros. Brawl*, *James Bond*. The game library of those two consoles is enough to stay safe at home during the coming zombie apocalypse.

[PPSSPP: PlayStation Portable](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp)
With at least 1370 games, and some awesome like Daxter, God Of War, Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear Solid‚Ä¶ there is absolutely no need to become addicted to modern game franchises, full of micropayments.

[PCSX2: Playstation 2](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2)
As far as I know, the Playstation 2 was the first console supporting online multiplayer. Also, with more than 1850 games we could stay in quarantine all our life.

[Retro Gaming with Raspberry Pi](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/books/retro-gaming) & [Raspberry pi emulator (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+emulator)
Last but not least, here are some resources to turn your Raspberry Pi into a retro gaming console üçì



## Open source games

[OpenArena tournaments](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=8756)
*OpenArena* is a community-produced deathmatch FPS which requires very little resources to run. Here is a community organizing online tournaments.


[SuperTuxKart](https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page)
SuperTuxKart is an open source mario kart look-alike which uses the mascots of the Free Software world as characters üêß


[Teeworlds](https://www.teeworlds.com/)
Teeworlds is a really fun 2D multiplayer shooter. This was our divertissement in high school when the teachers had their backs turned.


[Wikipedia: List of open-source video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games)
Here are a lot of other open source games that I couldn‚Äôt list.



## Open source GameDev

Maybe you want to use this free time to start developing your own games. Here is everything you need to start open source game development.


[Godot engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)
Godot is THE open source game engine. It has a really good and helpful community. There is already 2 books about it to help you getting started:
* [Godot Engine Game Development Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/eu/game-development/godot-game-engine-projects)
* [Godot Engine Game Development in 24 Hours](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35925637-godot-engine-game-development-in-24-hours-sams-teach-yourself)


[OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/)
OpengameArt regroups a lot of high quality, free (as in beer and as in speech) game assets. Really useful when you are a developer and don‚Äôt have so much graphic design talent.


[itch.io: free game assets](https://itch.io/game-assets/free)
Itch.io is a famous platform to share and discover indie games. They also provide some really good game assets for free.


[GitHub topics: GameDev](https://github.com/topics/gamedev)
Because I can‚Äôt list all the good projects, here is a pointer to discover other great open source GameDev projects.



## Security

Do you use Google Chrome or a derivative (like Chromium or Brave) as a web Browser? [It‚Äôs time to move to Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) which has added [a lot of security features recently](https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-for-mac-and-linux-to-get-a-new-security-sandbox-system/) :)


On March 18 was released an [important update for Google Chrome fixing 13 security issues](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_18.html) (which at least 9 are high severity).



Stay safe ‚úåÔ∏è
Sylvain
