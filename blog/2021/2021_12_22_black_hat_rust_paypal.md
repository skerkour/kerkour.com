I’m happy to announce that you can now purchase [Black Hat Rust](https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust/) with PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay thanks to [Paddle](https://paddle.com) which handles invoicing with VAT (if applicable) 🎉

Go here to buy Black Hat Rust with any of these payment methods: [https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust)

🔔 Because it took a very long time for my vendor account to be validated to accept these payment methods, I’ve reactivated the coupon **BLACK-HAT-WEEK** for 1 week, until Friday, December 31 at 11:59 PM 🔔

Enter it when you are asked to pay:

Happy end of the year 🍾
