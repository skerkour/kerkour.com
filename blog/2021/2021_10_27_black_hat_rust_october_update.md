after a small pause, here qe are again üöÄ

Pas de grande lettre aujourd/hui car les 2 dernieres semaines j'etais focus a finir black hat rust
mais ne vous desinscriver pas, j'ai du tres tres lourd qui arrive pour la semaine prochaine uqi va parler de e2ee ;)


dans l'introduxtion parler de la vision derriere le livre, rust language unifi√© pour lofdensive securit


While the Rust Book does an excellent job teaching What is Rust, a book about Why and How to Rust was missing -> c'est la direction du livre


save you time

If you value pragmatism and simplicity

**Just kidding**, after a short pause of deep work and flu recovery, I'm extremely happy to announce that **Black Hat Rust** is reaching completion and that [I just uploaded the version 2021.21](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) üçæ

- [100% of the code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust)
- [~90% of the words are available](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) (**355+ pages**)
- All the illustrations have been revamped




## Beta

The book is now entering its beta phase ü•≥

But, what is the *beta* phase?


99% of the value I wanted to share is already in the book:
- Code
- Illustrations
- Important ideas

But not all chapters have been reviewed so far, so some mistakes may remain (there **always** are mistakes...), some things may be weirdly worded, the current layout of the pdf is not perfect, and a few "coming soon" remain.


Thus, in the coming weeks, I will focus on:
- Writing the "coming soon"
- Gathering feedback
- Fixing mistakes
- Improving PDF's layout

Here is the [public roadmap](https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust/issues/25).


But for that, I need **your** feedback.

This is why I've created this special coupon that will save you **almost 30%** (more with VAT):
[https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BETA](https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BETA)

**Beware that the coupon expires next week, on Sunday, November 9 at 11:00 GMT.**

The only thing I ask in return is feedback about the content and the grammar. You bought the book and are annoyed by something? Please tell me, and I will do my best to improve it!

## Why Black Hat Rust?

If you're still reading at this point, you may be wondering **Why Black Hat Rust?** Why a book about hacking and Rust?

While the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) does an excellent job teaching **What** is Rust, a book about **Why** and **How to** Rust was missing.

The world of security (and, more generally, software) is plagued by too many programming languages with too many footguns. You have to choose between **fast and unsafe** (C, C++...) or **slow but mostly safe** (Python, Java...).

What if we could have language that is fast, memory safe, provide low-level controls and high-level abstractions? A language that could help us craft everything, from web servers, to shellcodes, passing by scanners and Remote Access Tools. All of that while being cross-platform. Sounds too good to be true?

It's not! Rust is **the** programming language that meets all these requirements. Of course, there are some pitfalls and a few things to know, but everything is covered in the book.



In the 14 chapters, we are going to build:
- A fast and reusable network scanner
- Cross-platform shellcodes
- A phishing toolkit and a website with WebAssembly
- A cross-platform Remote Access Tool
- Design and implement an end-to-end encryption protocol
- A cross-platform worm
- And many other tips and tricks

**Black Hat Rust** is a from-theory-to-practice guide, and you will greatly enjoy it if any of the following:
- You keep screaming "show me the code!" when reading about cyber attacks and malware
- You are a developer and want to learn security
- You are a security engineer and want to learn Rust programming
- You want to learn real-world and idiomatic rust practices
- You believe that the best defense is thinking like an attacker
- You learn by building and love to look under the hood
- You value simplicity and pragmatism

<!-- But, more importantly, **I share what I learned through years of experience and thousands of lines of code, so you don't have to make the same costly (in time) mistakes as I did**.

Indeed, the book is designed to save you a lot of time in your Rust and offensive security learning journey. So if you understand the value of your time, and understand that, in order to write secure code you have to think like an attacker, this book is for you! -->
