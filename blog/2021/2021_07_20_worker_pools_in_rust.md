Think twice. Worker pools are not a great fit for Rust due to its ownership model. Instead, embrace functional programming and immutable data. Rust provides simpler to use and more elegant tools: **parallel Iterators** and **Streams**.

> Update: Someone (rightfully) pointed out that I didn't really define what my definition of a worker pool is, so here it is: I consider a worker pool to be some kind of class that encourages stateful and mutable data while providing methods to execute tasks concurrently.

It's important to note that, like when working with worker pools in any programming language, an upper limit for concurrency should always be set up. Otherwise, you may quickly exhaust the resources of your system.

**For**:

* [I/O intensive jobs](#io-intensive-jobs-async)


## Compute intensive jobs

For compute-intensive jobs (CPU bound), there is the [`rayon`](https://docs.rs/rayon/) crate which provides [parallel Iterators](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelIterator.html): Iterators whose combinators are dispatched to a thread pool. The nice thing is that the thread pool is hidden from us, the developers. we just have to code as if we were using standard Iterators.

**Cargo.toml**
```toml
[package]
name = "rust_worker_pool"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Sylvain Kerkour <sylvain@kerkour.com>"]
edition = "2018"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"

rayon = "1"
```

**main.rs**
```rust
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
use rayon::prelude::*;
use std::time::Duration;

fn compute_job(job: i64) -> i64 {
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let sleep_ms: u64 = rng.gen_range(0..10);
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(sleep_ms));

    job * job
}

fn process_result(result: i64) {
    println!("{}", result);
}

fn main() {
    let jobs = 0..100;

    jobs.into_par_iter()
        .map(compute_job)
        .for_each(process_result);
}
```

By default, the thread pool has a size equal to the number of logical CPUs of the machine.


## I/O intensive jobs (async)

For I/O (Input/Output) bound jobs, we need to move to `async` land. More precisely, we will use [`Streams`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html), which are `async` Iterators that can process items concurrently.

But the [`Stream`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html) trait does not provide combinators itself. We need to import the [`StreamExt`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html) trait from the [`futures`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures) crate.

**Cargo.toml**
```toml
[package]
name = "rust_worker_pool"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Sylvain Kerkour <sylvain@kerkour.com>"]
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"

tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
futures = "0.3"
```


### for_each_concurrent

[`for_each_concurrent`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.for_each_concurrent) is the easiest to use as it consumes the Stream. It means that it does not return a Stream itself, but a Future, that can be `.await`ed.


**main.rs**
```rust
use futures::{stream, StreamExt};
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
use std::time::Duration;

async fn compute_job(job: i64) -> i64 {
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let sleep_ms: u64 = rng.gen_range(0..10);
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(sleep_ms)).await;

    job * job
}

async fn process_result(result: i64) {
    println!("{}", result);
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let jobs = 0..100;
    let concurrency = 42;

    stream::iter(jobs)
        .for_each_concurrent(concurrency, |job| async move {
            let result = compute_job(job).await;
            process_result(result).await;
        })
        .await;
}
```

### buffer_unordered

On the other hand, [`buffer_unordered`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.buffer_unordered) **does not consume** the Stream. This is why we need to use [`for_each`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.for_each) as a sink to consume the Stream.

**main.rs**
```rust
use futures::{stream, StreamExt};
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
use std::time::Duration;

async fn compute_job(job: i64) -> i64 {
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let sleep_ms: u64 = rng.gen_range(0..10);
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(sleep_ms)).await;

    job * job
}

async fn process_result(result: i64) {
    println!("{}", result);
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let jobs = 0..100;
    let concurrency = 42;

    stream::iter(jobs)
        .map(compute_job)
        .buffer_unordered(concurrency)
        .for_each(process_result)
        .await;
}
```


### Collecting results

Sometimes, instead of processing results directly we may need to collect them, to send them later in batch for example. Good news, the [`collect`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.collect) method is available on Streams:

**main.rs**
```rust
use futures::{stream, StreamExt};
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
use std::time::Duration;

async fn compute_job(job: i64) -> i64 {
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let sleep_ms: u64 = rng.gen_range(0..10);
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(sleep_ms)).await;

    job * job
}

async fn process_result(result: i64) {
    println!("{}", result);
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let jobs = 0..100;
    let concurrency = 42;

    let results: Vec<i64> = stream::iter(jobs)
        .map(compute_job)
        .buffer_unordered(concurrency)
        .collect()
        .await;
}
```
