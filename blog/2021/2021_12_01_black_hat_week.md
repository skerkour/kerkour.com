## v2021.40

It's now official, as of v2021.40, [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) is considered out of beta and complete!

Hundreds of typos have been corrected, layout issues have been fixed, and there is no more "coming soon" remaining. I've also added a few tips and tricks, such as how to perform an Evil Twin attack in chapter 9.

Of course, a few issues (such as subtle typos) may remain here and there. There **always** are mistakes. But nothing grotesque.

Today, [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) it's:
- More than **800** Early-Access and Beta supporters who made this project a reality. Thank you very much üôè
- **351** Pages for the PDF version
- [**9458** Lines of Rust open sourced](https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust)
- [More than **1000** GitHub stars](https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust)
- **9443** Lines of Markdown for the manuscript
- **1700+** Git commits for the manuscript
- **515** Git commits for the code
- **80** Illustrations

To celebrate that, I've decided to offer you the **biggest (and the last) discount of the year**: [https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLACK-HAT-WEEK](https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLACK-HAT-WEEK).

**This coupon is active only for 1 week, until ~~Wednesday, December 8 at 11:59 PM.~~ Due to demand, I've extended the coupon's validity period to Sunday, December 12 at 11:59 PM :)**

This is also the last week to get the awesome early-access bonus: A curated list of advanced malware analyses. You will find great inspiration inside for your own offensive tools.


## Distribution channels

I tried to publish the book on Amazon KDP (Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing), but it was a disaster.

The first thing is that it would add me a lot of tax forms to fill and nobody enjoy that. If it was only that, I could have surpassed my paperwork phobia.

But, the second, and most important thing, is the cut Amazon takes. You thought that the 30% cut Apple takes on the App Store is huge? Amazon takes **70%** (for a book that costs more than $9.99 or less than $2.99). And that's before taxes. I'm sorry Amazon, while I appreciate the buying experience on your marketplace, I respect my work and myself. I didn't work so hard on this book to give you the biggest piece of the cake just to move a few bits here and there üñï.

**Thus, I've decided to keep [Podia](https://www.podia.com) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as the only distribution channel. It just works and the fees are reasonable.**

If for some reason you **absolutely** can't buy the book by card, please [send me a message](https://kerkour.com).


## Why Black Hat Rust?

If you're still reading at this point, you may be wondering **Why Black Hat Rust?** Why a book about hacking and Rust?

The world of software is plagued by too many programming languages with too many footguns. You have to choose between **fast and unsafe** (C, C++...) or **slow but mostly safe** (Python, Java...).

What if we could have language that is fast, memory safe, provide low-level controls and high-level abstractions? A language that could help us craft everything, from web servers to shellcodes, passing by scanners and Remote Access Tools. All of that while being cross-platform. Sounds too good to be true?

It's not! Rust is **the** programming language that meets all these requirements. Of course, there are some pitfalls and a few things to know, but everything is covered in the book.


**[Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) is a distilled from-theory-to-practice guide teaching cryptography and how to code in Rust through applied security projects.**


In the 14 chapters, we are going to build:
- Design and implement an end-to-end encryption protocol
- A fast and reusable network scanner
- Cross-platform shellcodes
- A phishing toolkit and a website with WebAssembly
- A cross-platform Remote Access Tool
- An Evil Twin access point
- A cross-platform worm
- And many other tools, tips, and tricks

You will love it if any of the following:
- You keep screaming "show me the code!" when reading about cyber attacks and malware
- You are a developer and want to learn security
- You are a security engineer and want to learn Rust programming
- You want to learn applied cryptography
- You want to learn real-world and idiomatic rust practices
- You believe that the best defense is thinking like an attacker
- You learn by building and love to look under the hood
- You value simplicity and pragmatism


Also, while the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) does an excellent job teaching **What** is Rust, a book about **Why** and **How to** Rust was missing.


**Reminder: the coupon expires next week, on ~~Wednesday, December 8 at 11:59 PM.~~ Due to demand, I've extended the coupon's validity period to Sunday, December 12 at 11:59 PM :)** [https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLACK-HAT-WEEK](https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLACK-HAT-WEEK).

Now I'm going to sleep üòÖ
