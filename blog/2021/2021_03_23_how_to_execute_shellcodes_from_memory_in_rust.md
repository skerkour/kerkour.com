Executing code from memory in Rust is very dependant of the platform as all modern Operating Systems implement security measures to avoid it. The following applies to Linux.

There are at least 3 ways to execute raw instructions from memory:
* By embedding the shellcode in the [`.text` section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_segment) of our program by using a special [attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html).
* By using the [mmap](https://crates.io/crates/mmap) crate and setting a memory-mapped area as `executable`.
* A third alternative not covered in this post is to use Linux's [mprotect](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html) function.

## Our shellcode

We will use the following shellcode:

```
488d35140000006a01586a0c5a4889c70f056a3c5831ff0f05ebfe68656c6c6f20776f726c640a
```

Which is a basic hello-world for `x86_64`.

We can use the following command to write it to a binary file:

```
$ echo '488d35140000006a01586a0c5a4889c70f056a3c5831ff0f05ebfe68656c6c6f20776f726c640a' | xxd -r -p > shellcode.bin
```


```
$ objdump -D -b binary -mi386 -Mx86-64 -Mintel shellcode.bin

shellcode.bin:     file format binary

```


## Embedding a shellcode in the `.text` section

<!-- In modern OSes the `.text` section is <!-- A verifier !! the only one which can execute code.  -->

Embedding a shellcode in our program is easy thanks to the `include_bytes!` macro, but adding it to the `.text` section is a little bit tricky as by default **only the reference to the buffer** will be added to the `.text` section, and not the buffer itself.

It can be achieved as follow:

**main.rs**
```rust
use std::mem;

// we do this trick because otherwise only the reference of the buffer is in the .text section
// and not the buffer itself
const SHELLCODE_BYTES: &[u8] = include_bytes!("../shellcode.bin");
const SHELLCODE_LENGTH: usize = SHELLCODE_BYTES.len();

#[no_mangle]
#[link_section = ".text"]
static SHELLCODE: [u8; SHELLCODE_LENGTH] = *include_bytes!("../shellcode.bin");

fn main() {
    let exec_shellcode: extern "C" fn() -> ! =
        unsafe { mem::transmute(&SHELLCODE as *const _ as *const ()) };
    exec_shellcode();
}
```


```
$ cargo run
hello world
```

## Setting a memory-mapped area as executable


**Cargo.toml**
```toml
[dependencies]
mmap = "0.1"
```

**main.rs**
```rust
use mmap::{
    MapOption::{MapExecutable, MapReadable, MapWritable},
    MemoryMap,
};
use std::mem;

// as the shellcode is not in the `.text` section, we can't execute it as it
const SHELLCODE: &[u8] = include_bytes!("../shellcode.bin");

fn main() {
    let map = MemoryMap::new(SHELLCODE.len(), &[MapReadable, MapWritable, MapExecutable]).unwrap();

    unsafe {
        // copy the shellcode to the memory map
        std::ptr::copy(SHELLCODE.as_ptr(), map.data(), SHELLCODE.len());
        let exec_shellcode: extern "C" fn() -> ! = mem::transmute(map.data());
        exec_shellcode();
    }
}
```
