# Your early access bonuses{.unnumbered}

Dear reader, in order to thank you for buying the Black Hat Rust early access edition and helping to make this book a reality, I prepared you a special bonus: I curated a list of the best detailed analyses of the most advanced malware of the past two decades. You may find inside great inspiration when developing your own offensive tools.
You can find the list at this address:

If you notice a mistake (it happens), something that could be improved, or want to share your ideas about offensive security, feel free to join the discussion on Github:
