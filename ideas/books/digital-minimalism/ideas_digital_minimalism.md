The obesity eppidemic is the result of junkfood and is real.
What do you expect to be the result of the same process applied to junkfood for the brain?
dumb epidemic?

With reached a point of negative return: for each second spent on your screen, the value you get from your digital devices is a net negative for you (https://www.sevarg.net/2022/05/21/technology-and-diminishing-returns/).

What if you could get 1 more month every year?

According to a studies, an average ... use their smartphone for X hours a day.

```
Smartphones rob users of the ability to communicate person-to-person.

Visit any restaurant and you'll find example after example of people worshiping at their private electronic altars despite the presence of friends and family.

Or try having a conversation with almost anyone with a smartphone. The minute a notification goes off, they're gone. Master calls, bye.

It's a vicious cycle. Greater isolation leads to greater dependence on the fake bullshit being spewed.

Mindfulness: a superpower

As usual I planned for this week a technical topic, but I discovered something that blew my mind that I wanted to share it with you today

privation entrain de la frustration
-> And I guess the principle in this to make good habits easier and bad habits harder, thus by getting a dumb phone wasting 3 hours a day looking memes became harder and picking up my guitar or ham radio easier.

```
And when a large chunk of the actions in our life are reactive responses to stimuli (as opposed to intentional choices aligned with our values), we often start to feel a vague sense of dis-ease.

I think the seduction of going phoneless stems from the idea that because taking a few steps along this axis (using social media less) improved your life, then running all the way to some logical conclusion (not using a smartphone at all) will improve your life further.

I think this is a flawed temptation. Perhaps you would be better off finding the middleground that maximizes your life like exercising the self-domination of not pulling out your phone just because you are in an awkward social situation.

Just tank the situation with full conscious attention like a badass instead of escaping.



For many people phone addiction is just that, an addiction. For those people, this advice is like telling an alcoholic to be a badass and stop with just one drink.

A minimalist life can be many things, but at its heart is becoming conscious about what we have in our lives. Space is limited: we have limited hours in a day, limited years in our lives, limited physical space in our homes.

Anymore, for most people, a "smartphone" is just a black mirror you buy (a high end one costs more than most of the cars I’ve owned in my life), which you pay for monthly service on (also not cheap), that’s then used by a range of other people to try and turn your attention/eyeballs/etc into their money via advertising delivery. In exchange, they gather as much data as they possibly can on where you are, what you’re doing, who you’re near, and while I don’t think that most apps are actually listening to conversations, the reason people seem to think they are is because there’s enough predictive information extracted to make it seem that way.
```

```
Unless, of course, it’s a "Smart TV." Then it probably is doing all those evil things you’d rather your equipment not - and certainly doing ACR (Automatic Content Recognition) of any connected inputs to report up what you’re doing. Your DVD? Logged and reported. Gaming? Logged and reported. SmartTVs are not to be trusted in the slightest - but good luck finding some TV that isn’t "smart."

They had a "bug" in the beta in which Explorer (start menu, file navigation, just about everything of use requires explorer) crashed and wouldn’t operate. Why? Because there was an error in a blob of advertising JSON that Microsoft had published for some reason or another. If the ads are so tightly integrated in your OS that a bad ad blob breaks the entire OS functionality, again, I’m not OK with that. You’re no longer an operating system with that level of integration, you’re a behavioral extraction and advertising delivery system that also happens to run some programs. Of course the ads in Explorer when browsing files were "an experimental banner that was not intended to be published externally" - so, again, it sure looks like the "problem" with Windows 10 was that it just couldn’t serve enough ads for their quarterly growth targets.

When we industrialized food production we all started eating too much and too shitty and now practically all of us have overweight and unhealthy bodies. Feeds, push notifications, aggregators, to-do apps, notes apps, etc are all artifacts of the exact same process happening to our minds. It is so incredibly easy, so trivially easy, to spend 15 minutes on the internet and locate an effectively infinite amount of high-quality shit to read or watch or listen to. There's really too much for us to handle, so we build tools and services to help us manage all that information streaming towards us. But what we've forgotten is that we don't need to manage all the information out in the world, all we need to manage is however much we can ingest and digest. The bottleneck in our informational lives is absolutely not inventory management, it's the bandwidth between our ears, which is the same is it's always been.

this new world of connectedness really has some major downsides.

distracted driving.

instagram killing natural spaces from lack of crowd control.

decreased mental wellbeing and increased suicide rates.

facebook privacy concerns.

I've noticed on Hacker News a tendency where people declare phones to be distracting for them and thus the only solution is to stop using them.

I've been listening to the Cortex podcast recently. It is a productivity podcast by CGP Grey (youtuber) and Myke Hurley (runs a podcasting company). There is a big focus on the tech they use and how they make the most of it. There is a large focus their phones and iPads.

They both would probably agree that the garden-path with modern smartphones is a distracting mess. But where they differ is that assuming that means all hope is lost. They are quite advanced users of the systems they use but the basics can be done with only a bit of effort and will make a big impact.

* Go through your apps and purge ones you aren't using anymore.

* Go through the apps you chose to keep and explicitly set the notification settings for them. A lot of distracting apps are distracting because they use notifications to remind you that they exist.

* Remove time-sink apps from your home screen. You'll use them less if opening them takes more effort.

* Use the spots where time-sinks apps used to exist for apps you want to get into the habit of using. You'll have a few days of muscle-memory to exploit to your benefit.

* Take a look at what your calendar and reminder apps can do and start making use of them. They consider these two apps to be the core of the productivity software, and the basic apps will serve people for a long time.

* Look at Screen Time (or the Android equivalent) and see what it can do to further help you. You can set app limits and notification free periods (with exceptions). An interesting metric that is worth periodically checking is Pickups. This tracks what is the first app you switch to after unlocking your phone. It can be handy for identifying troublesome apps.

There is a lot of simple stuff that can make a big difference. That entire list can probably be done in the time it took me to write this. It seems so weird then to see how much of Hacker News is utterly defeatist and doesn't try.

If this did make you curious about the podcast, two episodes I think would make good jumping in points would be:

* #101 Productivity 101: An attempt to cover all the basics for someone just getting into productivity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eSCldom1Yc https://www.relay.fm/cortex/101

* #109 State of the Apps: This is a yearly overview of the apps they are using and what they get from them. They include screenshots of their homescreens in the shownotes which can make some useful inspiration. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIiOfhlBB4A https://www.relay.fm/cortex/109
