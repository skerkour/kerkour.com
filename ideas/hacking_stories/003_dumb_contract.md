Sarah is a very talented developer living in a country sanctionned by an international embargo.
Duee to this, she had to access GitHub with a pseudonyme and using VPNs.

Her open source work


Working in crypto


But due to the embargo, she can't find work in an international company. and all the companies in her country are shitty are governed by mysoginyc men.


She now live in a south american country, or african. We will never know.
