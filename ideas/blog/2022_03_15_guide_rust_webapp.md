Due to its unmatched reliability and performance, Rust is more and more appreciated by companies for building web services.

The costs saved thanks to lesser bugs and low resources usage are hard to estimate and depend on the worload,

So today, we are going to see how to build web applications in Rust.


## Architecture

[I've already covered how to design clean and scalable Web Applciations in Rust](/rust-web-application-clean-architecture) so we are only going


## Web framework

The role of the web framework is to route and parse requests, and encode responses.



## Database

## Templating


## Background jobs

## Sending emails

## Accessing external services



## The code is on GitHub

As usual, you can find the code on GitHub: [github.com/skerkour/kerkour.com](https://github.com/skerkour/kerkour.com/tree/main/blog/2022/rust_web_application) (please don't forget to star the repo üôè).
