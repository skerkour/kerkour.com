internet end of post wwii republics

if we look through another angle, the post wwii was a very unified, there was an official discohrse, teached in schools and broadcasted on the tv and radio, and alternative discourses were mostly limited to the circle of friends.

but now with internet, everybody can be exposed or learn aboht the alternate discoyhrses
