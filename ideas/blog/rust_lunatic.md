Dear Sylvain,

Thank you for your work, blog posts.

I am writing with kind request:

Could you consider extending your crawler series :
https://kerkour.com/rust-crawler-associated-types

with article(s) how to make it run on Lunatic:
https://lunatic.solutions/

I consider Lunatic very interesting (as biased fanboy of Elixir/Erlang
OTP, and ex Googler where I see how they copy cat copy pasted
shamelessly many designs from Erlang OTP), I always wanted to exercise
it , and at same time writing crawler very helpful to have one , but
also very nice example application that fits well Lunatic.

Also I am always short on time,
but at same time I was concerned with running random scrapers/crawlers
from internet of other people without reviewing their code for
security reasons.

Solutions based on WASI ro Lunatic, would allow me to use scrapers
provided by others,
(maybe happily pay for writing such, either cash or monero as I don't
have to know or trust developer...) , that way maybe community could
emerge around your blog posts (ok, now I went far with my visionary).

Basically, I learn a lot from your posts, enjoy reading them, and
trying out Lunatic would be great and your Crawler series seems like a
great fit for this.

Best regards,
Greg
