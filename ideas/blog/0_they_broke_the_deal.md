pour le lancement de bloom,
parler des reseaux sociaux qui


et maintenant ton contenu est derriere un wall

mais il faut bien se rendre compte d'une chose, la plupart des gens Ne sont **pas** sur ce reseau. If they clain 500M Users. It means that 7B people are not there.




So what can we learn from that.

First, never trust an internet service that is free, to stay like that. THey will have pressure from the people actually paying for the service, whether it be advertisers or investors.

Second, any social network that block content access behind a paywall has reached its peak and is slowly, but surely in it's declin phase. Why? Because it's a deseperate mesure. Taking hostage the content of people like that....


Instead, you should build your own place, your own garden that nobody can reclaim or block.

And this is why I created bloom
