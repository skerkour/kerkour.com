Let's say you have to implement *this* feature, but you are not sure if you have to use Rust or Go.

Here is my annecdotale experience.


|| **Rust** | **Go** |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| **Which lib to use?** | Let's use this 0.3 lib. I hope there is no bug or vulenrability because the creator seems very busy with is dayjob. | The standard library of course. |
| **Lines of Code** | 800 | 1000 |
| **Total time to implement the feature** | | |
| **Runtime speed** | | |
| **Compunded runtime speed for 100,000,000 operations** | | |
| **Monthly time spent for maintenance** | 1h (Updating dependencies) | 1h (Fixing bugs) |
