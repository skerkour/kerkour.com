Everybody has an idea about what we should do of our day:
- our boss want us to work late
- our girlfriend want to accompany her for shopping
- our mother want to visit her
- our friends want to go to the bar
- our cousin want to join him build her new startup idea
- our dog want to walk outside.
- our president want us to...

But a day is and will always be 24 hours. of which 8 are spent sleeping, 0.5 at the toilet. and 3 cooking / eating.

So it remains ~12 hours that we can choose what we want to tdo of.
