I've almost completely stopped using social network. It was a long journey, but I'm happy to.

problem woth social networks:

the asymetry of efforts between the consummers and the prpducers tends to abaisser au plus bas l'intelligence des debats.

il n'est pas rare de voire des gens commenter un article sans meme l'avpir lu ou comprendre les enjeux exposés


but first what I was looking for on social betworks?

for facebook it's staying connected with my relatices


for twitter, reddit and youtube it's content discovery


they capture our content


Conclusion

Would you consider eating junk food every day of your life? It would destroy your body. It's the same for you mental health. Feeding it with junk content may only destroy it.

Here are a few scientific studies about the effects of social networkds on the society/ humans



> There are all manner of reasons to get the fuck off Twitter, but one of the biggest is that it will drag your attention all over the place and slowly but surely give you a predominantly negative and nuanceless perspective on the world.

> There is Brandolini’s law: The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it. And the old line about lies traveling around the world before the truth even puts its boots on. "I’m just asking questions," people say when promoting conspiracy theories. They’re never just asking questions.
