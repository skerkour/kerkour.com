Killing burreaucracies: The challenge of the century

What is a burreaucracy

kafka trial

why it will be hard

Too many people depends on it

burreucracies are self-reinforcing:
The less its subject can do things, the more they'll have time to be bored, and the more they'll be able to think about "things that can be improved in th laws"


the hardest par is to dismantle these burreaucraies all while climate change willmake people want more regulation and will need more cooperation to face storms, flooding and droyght
I've seen a direct relationship between burreauvracies and and drug and screen usage among teenagers


burreaucracies come from the those who want to control
some people say: we need to control X. So they need to hire people
but few people question the fact that X really need to be controlled

bureaucracy = check and balancies
