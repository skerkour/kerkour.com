The thing to note about all these small companies is that the founders incrementally made improvements over many years.

This is contrasted by startups relentlessly chasing hyper growth asap, and bailing if they don't get it.

I personally tend to feel more zen just thinking about these small tech endeavors, and more agitated when thinking about startups chasing unicorns.
