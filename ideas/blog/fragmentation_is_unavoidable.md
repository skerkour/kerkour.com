Fragmentation has a similar ocncept in physics: entropy.

Hosrs, selon la seonc loi de la thermodynamique, l'entropy d'un systeme ferme ne fait qu'auguementation

Qui est donc en chartge d'eviter que l'ecosystem ne se fragmente trop?


local optimums and fragmentation

there is this tendency by people investing in tech to believe that technological evolution is the only way fprward.

the latest buzzword metaverse is the perfect example.

but as everyone who is not born during the last rain, I'm highly suspicious of concepts who VCs and sillicons megalos try to force puah into our gorge.

While this pattern is clear in the x last ywars, there are absolutely no physical rule underlying these claims, in the same way that perpetual "growth" (whatever it means) is not written.

this is why I want to take a few step back and reflect on how trchnology we have today is already awesome, and actually I believe have plateaued, and all these lubbies brough by wannabe cyborg are condamned to stay niche.

first why technology.

qhy everybody has different motivation to use technology, in my case it's less effort.

so, if a new technology don't improvr my quality of lifem but on the other have drawbacks (need to have a VR headset, high quality internet connection, eyesight loss) there are no chances I adopt it.

this is what let me think think that a lot of technologies already have reached a local optimum

transport: train + velo
...

so, of a certain technology has reached a local optimum, alnost everything is automated, how are we going to occupy our days?

by reinventing the whell, again and again.

This is why I think fragmentation.

a great example is notes spftware.

operating systems...
