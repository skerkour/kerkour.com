fragmentation

a lot of people love to dream about an unified world

second law of tgermodynamic

for example, our electronique in thr surface unified with the USB c connector. But now the standard is so huge and complex, that the fragmentation is happening from the iniside, different power supply...

Conclusion

I belive that only big events can bring unifications (major rewrite, war...)
