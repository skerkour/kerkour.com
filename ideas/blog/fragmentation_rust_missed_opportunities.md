Solution:

I believe tthat Go has perfectyl nailed it .It provides a big std libbut which is aplitted abd bot stagnatte]]Yes, the stdlib is not perfect (ex: there a countles of web framework, **not** using the stdlib) but the std lib is good enough for 90% of the people and most of the efforts of the community go to provide value of top of it, not reimplementing the whell countless times.



Now imagine you want to learn rust, you have to learn a lot of new concepts (ownership, async...) all of that for what: write an hello world.

But let be honest, a modern hello world is a web server.

But, as you are a newbie, how do you know which runtime to choose? Bob is saying `async-std`, Alic is saying `tokio`...
You don't you just pray

The idea is not to provide the perfect solution, but one that is good enough 80% of the time

## Web
