The parallele between The car and software industries

We are slowly realising that building our societies around was a stupid idea. Dom't get me wrong, cars are certainly one of the underlying factors of of a lot of progress, but requiring 1.5 tons of metal (and growing) releasing toxics gases and microplatics directly to our lunges, and greenhouse gases leading to global warming to do just about everything in our lives, is wrong.

Unfortunately, we are following a parallel trend with software.
