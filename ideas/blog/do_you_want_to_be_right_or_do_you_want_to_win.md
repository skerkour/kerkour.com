Do you want to be right, or do you want to win?

When I read my (not so) older articles, I have this weird sentiment of always wanting to be right. A aive sentiment that truth (whatever it means nowadays) will always win.




For texample, tkae thearticle about what we can do to slow down the destruction of the planet.

While the content is
It has 0 chance to convince someone who does not alread yagree with the ideas.

Put in another way. It has 0 impact.


## Why we want to be right


why?

https://xkcd.com/386/

Ego. Ego, ego, ego.

This dear friend that (almost) everybody pretends to have break up with long time ago, yet


But as I get older I slowly realize that culture will always over truth and science.

So,

Do you want to be right, or do you want to win?


Why we love to be right
-> For me, it's because I'm hyper rational and I think that being objective is a pre-requisite for peaceful social relations





## The importance of culture

Ho boy how I'm wrong.


For example, tkae NFTs. Buying a few bits

Are people selling NFTs scammers? Maybe not, as after all they don't use force to corcise or they don't even lie about what they are selling. They are just playing with the emotions and animals instinct of the bbuyer (of making a lot of money fast).
