Hi Sylvain,

What I've seen happening quite a few times is that it's hard for
employees to get raises. Salaries of (equally qualified) employees
that just start are often much higher than that of current employees,
leaving the latter disgruntled and eventually cause them to leave the
company to start somewhere else.

This result is years - sometimes a decade - of domain knowledge being
lost. The new employees have to work in code they didn't write
themselves, being far less efficient than their predecessor.

I think it's a topic that deserves a blog post :)
