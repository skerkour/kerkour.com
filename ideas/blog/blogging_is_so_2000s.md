and it's a good thing actually!

long form content is so 2000


I sometime receive remarques du style, mais pourquoi tu blogs?
en 2021 les gens qui ont du succes sont sur tiktok, youtube et instagram.


complexity of SSg

il faut des fois plusieurs minutes pour qu'un changement soit en ligne.
entre la cicd, le rendering, le cache busting...
c'est ca le progres?

la technique est une diversion. le coeur du sujet est:
- le message
- l'audience
- la vente


## Qualite de transmission de l'infromation


Video -> bon pour emotions

Texte -> information.

Vous souvenez vous du plan des 10 dernieres videos que vous avez regard√©?


## Ads

I viceraly hate ads. I've nothing against some content creator promoting their own content, I;m doing it after all, we need to eat.

**but** stupid, unrelated, ads that whose sole purpose is to hijack my brain. This is a big NO. Fuck you advertisers. You are wasting billion of human-hours per year (month? Week??)



## Capture our content

Another big No



If you want to share photos, you have almost no other choice than instagram. If you want to share videos it's youtube.

On the other hand, if you want to blog, you have the choice among hundreds of platforms that mays suit your need. And most of the time, you will be able to import and export your content.


## Poor search


It may change in the future, but it will always be derriere la recherche de texte.

## Minimalism

And finally, a more personal reason, is that I love minimalism: I love to focus on what I think is essential. And when you start creating content for those platforms, you now have a hundred problems...

You now need a camera, one or two microphone, a video editing software, a photo editing software pour la miniature... it never stops. I don't want to have to learn and manage all those things.


Furtheremore it takes a loot of time! I'm not saying that blogging don't take time, research, writing, spell checking, editing takes a lot of time. But editing video and audio will always take more time.


## It's easier to automate

Related to minimalism, as the text format is simpler, there is also a lot more tooling. It's extremely easy to automate posting, and sharing on social media.

I always write my blog posts in advance. I could leave my computer for weeks (unfortunately not as common as I would want), my blog would be on autopilot and would continue to live for weeks, without me.
