why writing will always win

writing is slow.

when was the last time you time to think by yourself when watching a video or listenning to a podcast.

on the other hand with writing, you can make a pause without clicking any button.

d'ailleurs faites une pause maintenant.

think about what you juat read. Do you agree?

really.
