science, art or religion?

while aoftware developers love to talk about their craft as engineering: applied science and aome other as a creative thing (art) we can observe on internet communities such as hacler news or reddit that talks about prframming labguages and practices seems kind of religious

concluaion: even if we use terms that sound smart auch as modelization...
i will always consider proframming an art, there is no one truth, amd fhe biggest challenges revolving aroung how humans problems (regarder tao of go, debugging, code reading...)

i will qlways be sad to see so fpamed conversations on forums.
