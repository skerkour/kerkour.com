After reading [many great things about Rust and saw your [favorite companies using it in production](https://kerkour.com/rust-in-production-2021) you think it's now your turn to be part of the adventure.

But you are not sure where to start. First because you can do [so many things](https://kerkour.com/rust-is-minimalist) with Rust, from embedded development to web application, passing by scientific computing. Second because there are too many resources on the web.

This is why I compiled what I consider to be the best resources to Learn Rust in 2022.


How to learn rust in 2021
The Rust book -> what is Rust
My book -> How to Rust

The free books are very good, but as the information os spread it takes more time, and if you value your time, it's not necessarily worth it
