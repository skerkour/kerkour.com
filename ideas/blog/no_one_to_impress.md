what your life would look like of ypu had no one to impress?

Take a few second to think about it.

Would you have the same job? Would you have the same car?


One thing I really appreciate with blogs is that I can write freely what I think, I have no one to impress.

Nobody

On the other hand, on social network when some topic is debates, you will have 1/3 that don't even know or experience what is debated but have an "internet expert" opinion on it, 1/3 that is here just to prove every one else that they are the martest person in the room, and finally 1/3 that guenuinly try to find and understand the best solution.
