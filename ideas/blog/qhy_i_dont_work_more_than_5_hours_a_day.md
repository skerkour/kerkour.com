why I don't work more than 5 hours a day


after that my focus is dramaticaly low and my marginal efficiency per hour of wprk just doesn't justify any more work
so no, I don't put a timer a full stop after 5 hours, but starting at 4 hours of work, I start sonder mon esprit pour voir si ca vaut la peine de continuer
