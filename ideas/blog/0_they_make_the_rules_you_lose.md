Does it means that people don't like his content. I don't think so. I think it's more that his content is ranked low by the algorithms because his tweets consists only of a link to an external website. And if you follow a link to an external website, you leave the platform. They will always do what is in their best interest. not yours.


So yeah, you worked for them for free. You brought people, Your grown a fidele audience. You make people spend more time on their platform because they were waiting for new content from you.

And now they give you a big finger.

So today It's time to break this abusive relationship.
