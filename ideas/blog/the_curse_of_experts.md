The [Dunningâ€“Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) (people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability) is a well discussed topic on the internet, but its opposite, the curse of expertise is less. A few weeks ago, I was confronted to a situation where my knowledge prevented me to find the best solution to a problem, so I thought it was interesting to share what I learned.

A friend who was teaching programming to business people asked us what is the simplest way to code a small website. Having built dozens of website, for me the answer was obvious:
Go. Because you can create a web server in ~10 lines, the typing is relatively strong, everything is in the standard library, and it's easy to created Docker images. Who would'nt want to create a website in 2021 without strong typing??

But do you really need strong typing, to know what is the standard library, and to use Docker when you are learning programming for a few days and just need a website?

Of course no! A better answer is Python.

What I want to illustrate with this little story is that when you spend too much time in field, there is a tendency to overthink everything which is really counter productive.


## Remedy


**Stop to think about expert only issues**: <br />
Experts tend to think only about micro-optimizations. They often forget the bigger picture. Start to think about more simple problems.


**Dedicate time to help newcomers**: <br />
il est bon de passer un peu de temps chaque mois, a etudier les questions que se posent les debutants dans ce domaine.
: By helping people who are at the beginning of their learning journey! By listenning to their questions and conscientizing what they really want.
