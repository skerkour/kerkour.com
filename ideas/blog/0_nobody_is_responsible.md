blog: what happens when nobody is responsible
we live in funny times when everytime you hear something from someone with some amount of pokwer, you understand that the reality is the exact opposite.

one of the favorite sentence of those with some amount of power is"i take the fullresponsability"
when someone say that ypu know that they take absolhtrly no reponsability and than maybe someone under them will be fired if a private company, or delegated in another ministery if talking aboht the government
