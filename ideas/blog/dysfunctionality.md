root causes of dysfunctionnality

before going to programming, i was in law university (tldr it didn't well)

even morde than code, laws have a real impact on people, and still I think we may all agree that our modern spcieties, governed by those laws are highly dysfunctionnal.

in this post on ne va pas explorer la corruption et les autres causes qui pourraient la cause de dysfunctionnality

mais


how to create highly dysfunctionnal organization

Whether it be our atates, startups or...
it seems that there is some kind of contest to create the most dysfunctionnal organization as possible.

Here is my 5 points tutorial to be sure to create the most dysfunctionnal, hated by everyone involved, but finally not out of the norm organization

1. the people making decision should not be affected by those decisions...
    bonus point if they don't even understand les enjeux

2. no accountability

3. use the money of someone else


a kind of race to the bottom



4. no communication

when everyone think something different, and all efforts are epparpillés, you are sure to nevere, ever win



5. never analyse your results or your errors

la courbe doit toujours pointer vers le haut donc il est preferable de changer ce quo est mesuré


6. add as many indirection layera as possible. You dont want to people understand how the whole organization works!
