Why entrepreneurs are the best customers

They are less risk sensitive

They can take decisions by themselves

They understand the value of their time



They care less about authority

This is something that I have noticed when doing partnership with students in business schools, where, most are takers and sheeps, and few are entrepreneurs

A figure of authority is so important for them
You can tell them something, but if you are a nobody youâ€™ll hear 1000 objections

The exact same thing said by a famous entrepreneur or rich manager and it becomes the absolute truth
