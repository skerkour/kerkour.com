How often you’re saying "Yes" to things?

    Yes, mom, I will help you understand what the internet is.
    Yes, John, I’ll help you clean up your terrace.
    Yes, Sindy, I’ll go with you to the mall even though I have work to do.
    Yes, Charles, I will smoke weed with you even though I don’t really want to.
    Yes, Claudia, I will go out with you so I can help you overcome your 3rd relationship for this month.
