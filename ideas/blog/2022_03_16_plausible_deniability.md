Today, I want to take time to develop one of the most important concept that you can learn to win in adversarial situation, whether it be cyber operations, business, or even ...


## Story


## Plausible deniability

<!-- Plus d'examples -->


Plausible deniability is absolutely not limited to [Black Ops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_operation), secret services or militaries.

Politicians, big corporations, and maybe even you, are all great masters of


## Some closing thoughts

While everybody love to call the "modern world" (whatever it means)  "The post-truth era", I believe that Humans never really liked reality and always prefered to believe either the simplest explaination, or the one defending their interests.

Thus, if knowing the truth always has been hard, my rule of thumb to try to understand what really happen(ed) is to follow money and power.


For a given initiative, looking for who is going to benefit the most in terms of money and power is probably the explaination the closest to the "truth".

Of course it has its limits because incompetency and luck exist, or because the intent of an initiative carried by a great strategist may be hard to understand, but I believe that it's healthy to be suspicious when a party got too much luck.
