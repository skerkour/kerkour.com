in 2017, I bought a one way ticket to thailand to start a new life as a difital nomad.

i already had read stuff on the tipic so I knew that having only a carry on bag had many advantages

but i couldnt make it and settled on two bags, qith many gadgets 'cjust in case"...

*The things you own end up owning you.* Chuck Palahniuk

Today I've managed to reduce the list of things I use and own to fit in a single carry-on backpack.

<!-- TODO: photo du sac plein -->

It was a looong and sloow process started 6 months ago when I started to realize that I didn't use a lot of stuff
(clothes, gadgets, books...) I owned, and it vampirized a lot of my time and energy (when cleaning my room, washing my clothes, choosign my outfit of the day...).

Without waiting any further let's explore the reasons why someone would want to reduce it's possessions to the bare minimum.

## Benefits

I can't list all the benefites since there is too much, but here is a few which come to my mind:
* don't have to pay for checked luggage
* reduced cognitive load to choose my daily outfit
* ability to pack and relocate to anywhere in the world in less than 15 minutes
* all my stuff is high quality. If something is damaged, it's fixed or replaced
* the places where I live are always in order and easy to clean
* an unparalleled ability to travel and see beautiful places
* wash cycles are easier (1 / week)
* reduced ecological footprint
* you can keep a similar bag at your parrent's or girlfriend's house in case your's got stolen
* don't have to spend time selling old stuff
* my hands are free when I need to carry something else (girlfriend's bag, groceries...)

## Drawbacks

I don't know if it's because I'm overly enthusiast, but I have really hard time to find drawbacks:
* I love to do martial arts and combat sport. I had to leave my stuff at my parents' home and usually need to buy/rent stuff when abroad
* your friends will see you everyday with the same clothes and may behave strangely

For a <a href="https://reddit.com/r/onebag" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>oneBagger</i></a> I have a lot of underwears, I know.
It allows me to do sport 3 times per week and still have to worry about washing my clothes only once a week.

The black jean is used with a black turtleneck when formal dressing is *required*.
