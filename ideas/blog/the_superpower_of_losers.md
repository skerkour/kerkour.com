the super power pf losers

they have nothing to lose

now you may be wondering, how can I win and still keep this superpower?

minimalism

you have to dissociate with owning

I own almost nothing, yet I feel I'm pretty succesful

because my notion of success is related to experience

my life is by design not stressful...
