Hey,

For me, i suggest it should be a generic rather than a specific one. I mean the content should not related to a specific blockchain/ecosystem, because that would require the readers to have some existing knowledge on that specific blockchain/ecosystem. (maybe that should be a separate book itself)

I think the book can be divided into two parts. In the first part, we can implement some of the most famous consensus algorithms, e.g BFT, and on top of that build a new blockchain. Then in the second part, we can build an off-chain bridge between any of the EVM-based blockchains.

Thank you
