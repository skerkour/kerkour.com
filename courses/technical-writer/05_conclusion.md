By now, I hope that you feel confident enough to write your first technical book, so it's **YOUR** turn.

You may be tempted to read more resources on how to write a book to be sure to do it right.

I recommend you **NOT TO DO THAT**. Instead, start writing your book **now**, make mistakes, notice where you have difficulties, and only then start reading specific resources to improve your weaknesses.

Ultimately, remember that done is better than perfect, and even if your first book is not impeccable, you will be able to learn from your mistakes and either edit it, or write a new one.


Goooooo!
