<!-- Maybe today you want to write your own book, whether it be to share a unique perspective you have on technology, to become renowned in your field, or simply for money. -->

When was the last time you felt really proud of your work?


In early 2021, I started what I consider now as maybe the most rewarding journey of my life: writing a book.

Writing a book is among those few things that, once done, make you really, really proud of yourself.

We all have different reasons to write a book, whether it be to share a unique perspective you have on technology, to become renowned in your field, or simply for money. But one thing is sure, almost all people who wrote a book would rate the experience as a 10/10.


From the first words to thousands of readers and more than $80,000 in sales, I'm going to share with you everything that I learned along the way and help you achieve the same or even more!

## Who can write a book

The only prerequisite to writing a book is to be passionate (not necessarily an expert) about a topic.

Today, you know things that you didn't know 1 year or 6 months ago. It means that there are thousands to millions of people who want to learn what you learned along the way.
