# Introduction


## What is a book, actually?

I know that you know what a book is... A few sheets of paper strapped together that you can buy in a bookstore.

But that's not the answer I was waiting for.

A book is a **knowledge product** (also called information product, but I prefer to use the term *knowledge*)

It's a way to transfer knowledge from one Human to many others, and, most of the time, be paid to do so.

Books are not the only existing knowledge products:
- video courses
- podcasts
- online courses like this one...

There are many ways to share and sell knowledge.

So, why would someone want to write a book?


## Why write a book

**Everyone knows what a book is**: Books exist since thousands of years, and thus, and thus are here to stay, according to the [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect). Most people buy and read books since they are children, so this behavior is already anchored into the habits of customers.

**Making money**: As we will see in chapter 3, by self-publishing your book, you can make decent money. As I'm writing this, a little bit more than 1 year after the initial announcement of my book, I made more than $80,000 in sales.

**Being recognized by your peers**: Writing a book will give you certain visibility in your community which can lead to many opportunities such as interviews, job offers, or freelance contracts.


**Text and illustrations easy to update**: It's very hard to update a video or a podcast, that's why so few people bother and that video and audio creators treat their output as fire and forget. On the other hand, it's really easy to update text and illustrations so you can offer lifetime updates to your readers or sell a 2nd edition of your book a few years after the first edition.


**It requires no investment**: You can write, publish and sell a book with a simple smartphone. Of course, I do not recommend that, but I want to show you that you don't need to purchase a new camera, a powerful computer for video editing, huge hard disks or whatever to write a book.

**You can write a book from anywhere**: Related to the point above, as the stuff required to write a book is minimal, you can do it from anywhere: a big city, a cabin in the woods or while traveling.

But, writing a book, there also are many, many reasons why someone would **NOT** want to write a book.


## Why not a book

**Undervalued**: Most people think that a book should cost between $10 and $30 so it's hard to sell your book at a higher price point. Thus, to make a profit, you'll need to sell at least one thousand books.

I will tell you an open secret: [Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)](https://kdp.amazon.com) takes a 70% cut if the price of your book is less than $2.99 or more than $9.99, while, if your book costs between $2.99 and $9.99, they take "only" 30%. And this is before taxes.
This is why you can find so many cheap books on Amazon, that take ~100 pages to explain and illustrate only 1 idea...


**It takes a looot of time**: If you are not committed full-time to your book, it can take many months to 1+ year to complete your book. That being said, by following the strategies of this course, you should be able to write your book in 90 days.

**A book needs to be updated**: Whether it be frameworks, tools, or best practices, technology evolves. For example, while writing my book about the Rust programming language, between the start and the publication dates, some features of the language evolved and I needed to update the book before having completed it...
Worse, is that if you want to update your book after its publication and provide lifetime updates to your readers (like I do), it's not necessarily easy to distribute the updated version to all your customers.

This is the reason that I now prefer to write online courses: to update the course, I just need to edit a Markdown file, push it to Git and that's all.



## Early Access

As mentioned above, writing a book is really time-consuming, so you certainly don't want to write a book that nobody is going to read.

The best way to make sure that enough people are interested by your book is to launch it after having written only the first chapter.


Before pre-selling your product, you should find the answers of the 2 following questions:
- What is your target number of sales? This means: below how many sales do you abandon the project?
- What will you do if you don't hit this number? Refund your customers? Pivot to something else?


### The plan to launch your book in Early-Access

**Write down the plan**: X chapters. Take your time to define the plan of your book, because then it's really hard to change it. For each chapter, note down the 3-6 most important ideas you want to share.

**Write the 1st chapter**: Take 1 week to write the first chapter. Do your best because early-access buyers will judge you on it. Refer to chapter 2 to learn how to write a technical book.

**Setup a platform to sell your book and distribute the updates**: Which one to choose? We will see in Chapter 3.


**Write a landing page**: This is the link that you are going to send everywhere. This is your product page. How to convert visitors into customers? This is the topic of chapter 4.

**Finally, launch your book**: Which platforms? When to launch it? We will see everything you need to know in Chapter 4.
