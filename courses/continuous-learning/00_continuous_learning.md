How many tabs are open in your web browser right now?

Do you remember the important ideas from the last book that you read?

And of the last educational video that you did watch?

Every day our brain is submerged with information, and very few people know how to turn this information into actionable knowledge. Those who do are the winners of today's world: they can identify signal among the noise and use it to achieve their goals.


While more knowledge always allowed Humans to have the edge over their peers, it's even more true today where information is available to everyone thanks to the internet and cheap computing devices, but knowledge is reserved for those capable of filtering the signal among the noise.




On the other hand, the traditional education system is totally unsuitable
 for our world, where it seems that it's okay to just stop learning new things after 25.

This is what led me to develop my own system to continue to learn during my entire life. A system that is simple and actionable.
* **Simple** because complex things cannot last for a long time before they collapse under their own complexity.
* **Actionable** because knowledge is nothing without action

And today I'm sharing this system with you.

I've nothing more than a high-school degree, and yet I managed to learn by myself a few programming languages, software programming, offensive cybersecurity, online business,

Internet, computers and smartphone made the amount of information avaiable to the average Human exploded.

Podcasts, Videos, books, online course, blog posts, tweets... Some algorithms exist to curate this flow of data, but they are most of the time optimised to drive revenue to huge corporation instead of enlighting the users.



 **This trend will not reverse.**


 But, most people consume content and hardly remember anything about it. Here are a few symptoms:

* Can you remember the plan and main ideas of the last YouTube video ou watched?
* Do you have 1000s of open tabs in your web browser?
* Can you remember the important points of the last book you read?

Since we intered the information age with the advents of computers, internets and robots, most of the tasks left to Humans

And this trend will not reverse.

But, most people have a hard time learning new things. We learn during our school years,
