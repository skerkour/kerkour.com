## The future of knowledge bases

With the emergence of advanced and Open Source Machine Learning models such as the recent [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) (open sourced last week as I'm writing this), we can expect that in the near future, we will be able to train an AI on our own knowledge base that will be able to answer advanced questions instead of having to rely on basic search and hashtags.

The biggest advantage of these AIs versus a traditional Google is that they will use information and data that you already vetted as it was saved into your knowledge base instead of the SEO-filled web.

## A few more tips

One of the biggest barriers to knowledge assimilation is distractions.

While it's easy to limit visual distractions by practicing isolation, it's, in my experience, harder to limit auditive distractions.

My solution is to use "white-noise" sounds during my learning sessions. Those are songs that are repetitive, so your brain no longer pays attention after a few minutes and that cover the sounds from outside, from the road or your co-workers, for example.

## Your turn

If not already done, download a knowledge base software now!

Then, start filling it with content from all your open tabs or bookmarks, until you no longer have open tabs, and that all your remaining bookmarks are day-to-day applications such as Banking, Netflix, or whatever.
