Intro:
I got some feedback about Mailchimp's supposed link tracking. To be clear, Link tracking is **disabled** in all my emails.


I'm really sorry for the incovenience, encore some bureaucratic bullshit.


I'm testing a new format. Just after sending email, I start regretting some sentence, expression or idea. But it's too late

I want **your feedback**: f you think it's a bad idea, just explain me why be replying to this email.
