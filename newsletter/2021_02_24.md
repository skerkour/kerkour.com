# Rust for web development: 2 years later

Hello everyone,

I'm making good progress on my book about Rust and cybersecurity (Here is a [coupon to save 10â‚¬](https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG) if you don't already have it) and I expect to release the draft of the second chapter before the end of the week.

---------------------

I started developing web services in Rust a little bit more than 2 years ago, so I thought it was time to shake the preconceived ideas and share what I've learned.

## The prejudices

**Rust code is ugly**: Rust is explicit. Undeniably. But when I'm writing code, my IDE is helping a lot, and I don't have to press that much key. When I read code, this explicitness is just awesome! No hidden surprises, no weird things.

**Memory management is a distraction**: Actually, no. I don't use that many lexical lifetimes and use instead smart pointers. So yes, I have to understand the differences between a `Box`, an `Rc` and an `Arc`, but my productivity is not impacted compared to Node.JS or Go.

**Compiler is a pain in the a****: At the beginning, yes. But after a few months, you'll be able to understand all the errors instantly and fix them in a blink. Today I really don't spend much time fighting with the compiler. Instead, it became my best friend, especially when refactoring large portions of code or upgrading dependencies :)

**Slow compile times**: I accord you this one. When in Node.JS or Go a medium-sized service's Docker image takeÎ© 5 to 10 mins to build and deploy, in Rust it will be about 30 minutes.

**The ecosystem is not there**. Yet. Yes, some pieces are missing, such as a Stripe SDK or an official AWS library, but the community is really active and created all those missing pieces.

## A few things I particularly appreciate

**Static linking is remarkably easy**: Creating [small Docker images](https://github.com/skerkour/bloom/blob/main/Dockerfile) is a delight.

**Rust will make you a better programmer**: Rust is complicated and won't leave you alone if you don't understand how it works in detail. It takes time and patience to master, but once you do, you'll have learned so many things that you'll never approach programming as before. I understood how Go's runtime works while learning how [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) works.

**Once it compiles, it works** (usually). This is my favorite thing about Rust. When my program compiles, it works as I planned. You have to keep in mind not blocking the event loop, and the compiler will take care of everything else. You no longer have to spend time writing tests for the quirks of the language.

**Rust is productive**: Because Rust is multi-paradigm, it really shines when writing complex business logic, thanks to its functional aspects.

**Crates I use**:
* [actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) for the HTTP layer.
* [rusoto](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto) to interface with AWS services for storage, background jobs and sending emails.
* [tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) for email templates.
* [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) for HTTP requests.


## Conclusion

Rust is a real pleasure to use for web development, and I thoroughly recommend it. It is so versatile that, without a doubt, it's the last programming language I learned. Ever.

It's a long journey to become effective, but totally worth it, and even if you don't use it every day, you'll for sure become a better programmer by learning it and, if lost, rediscover the joy of programming ðŸ¤—

In a word: Rust is boring. No more bad surprises at 3 A.M. No more bugs because a dependency updated its API. No more annoying manual configuration for auto-scaling and whatever. And welcome response times so small that your users will fall in love with your product.

If you want to learn more from real-world Rust experience, I'm writing a book (available in early access) where, among other things, we will create and deploy HTTP services in Rust.
