Hello everyone,

The past weeks were pretty intense, so this week there is no 1, but **2** tutorials:
* [How to execute shellcodes from memory in Rust](https://kerkour.com/rust-execute-from-memory/)
* [How to create small Docker images for Rust](https://kerkour.com/rust-small-docker-image/)

<br />

The topic of this week: 42 Companies using Rust in production
